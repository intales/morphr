# The `morphr register` Command

The first step to using Morphr is to create an account. The `register` command walks you through the account creation process.

## Basic Usage

```bash
morphr register
```

When you run this command, the CLI will guide you through an interactive registration process:

1. You'll be prompted to enter your email address
2. You'll be asked to provide your name
3. You'll need to create a password (and confirm it)

After submitting this information, Morphr will send a verification code to your email address. You'll need this code for the next step.

## Example

```
$ morphr register
📧 Enter your email address: your.email@example.com
📝 Enter your name: John Doe
🔑 Create a password: ********
🔑 Confirm your new password: ********
📤 Account registration in progress...
✅ Registration completed successfully!
📧 We have sent you an email with a verification code.
📝 Use the "morphr verify" command to verify your new account.
```

## Notes

- Choose a strong password for your account
- The CLI will save your User ID automatically in your local configuration
- Check your spam folder if you don't receive the verification email

## Command Options

You can also provide information directly as command options:

```bash
morphr register --email=your.email@example.com --name="Your Name"
```

Or using the short form:

```bash
morphr register -e your.email@example.com -n "Your Name"
```

Once you've completed registration, proceed to the verification step using the `morphr verify` command.
