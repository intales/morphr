# Offline Fallback System

Morphr includes a fallback system that ensures your app can display UI components even when a network connection isn't available. This system works by maintaining a local copy of your Figma design that can be used when cloud synchronization isn't possible.

## How It Works

The fallback system operates in three main ways:

1. **Development Time**: When you run `morphr sync`, the command not only synchronizes your project with the cloud but also saves a copy of the current design to your project's assets folder.

2. **App Initialization**: When your app starts, Morphr first tries to load any locally cached design file. If this fails, it falls back to the asset version included in your app bundle.

3. **Background Synchronization**: After initialization, Morphr attempts to synchronize with the cloud in the background, preparing updated designs for the next app launch without disrupting the current session.

## Setting Up the Fallback System

### 1. Configure Your pubspec.yaml

To enable the fallback system, you need to declare the assets directory in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/morphr/
```

This tells Flutter to include the Morphr design files in your app bundle.

### 2. Initialize Morphr in Your App

Make sure you initialize Morphr with the cloud options:

```dart
import 'package:morphr/morphr.dart';
import 'package:your_app/morphr_options.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize Morphr with cloud support
  await MorphrService.instance.initializeCloud(options: morphrOptions);
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### 3. Run Sync During Development and Deployment

Before deploying your app, always run the sync command to update the fallback file:

```bash
morphr sync
```

This ensures that your app ships with the most recent version of your design as a fallback.

## How the Fallback is Used

The fallback is automatically used in the following scenarios:

1. **First Launch**: When a user first installs your app and has no cached design file
2. **Network Errors**: When the app can't connect to Morphr Cloud
3. **Sync Failures**: If the synchronization process encounters errors

In these cases, Morphr will seamlessly use the fallback file to ensure your app's UI renders correctly, even without an internet connection.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Run `morphr sync` regularly during development and always before building release versions of your app
2. **Version Control**: Include the fallback file in version control to ensure consistent builds
3. **Testing**: Test your app in airplane mode to verify the fallback system works correctly
4. **Asset Size Awareness**: Be mindful that including the fallback file increases your app's bundle size

This approach provides an excellent balance between updating your UI and ensuring availability, making your app robust even in offline scenarios.
