# The `morphr init` Command

After connecting your Figma account, you need to initialize a Morphr project and link it to your Figma file. The `init` command must be run inside an existing Flutter project directory.

## Basic Usage

```bash
cd your_flutter_project
morphr init
```

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Verify you're logged in to your Morphr account
2. Ask for your Figma file URL
3. Verify access to that Figma file
4. Create a new Morphr project on the cloud
5. Sync the Figma file with your project
6. Generate configuration files in your Flutter project

## Prerequisites

- You must run this command inside a Flutter project directory
- You must be logged in to your Morphr account
- You must have already connected your Figma account (using `morphr figma-connect`)
- You must have access to the Figma file you want to link

## Example

```
$ cd my_flutter_app
$ morphr init
üîó Paste your Figma file URL: https://www.figma.com/design/abcdefghijklm
üîç Verifying access to Figma file...
üìù Enter a name for your Morphr project [Flutter Project]: My Awesome App
üöÄ Creating project on Morphr Cloud...
üîÑ Syncing project...
‚úÖ Morphr project initialized successfully!
üìÇ Configuration file generated at lib/morphr_options.dart
üìù Now add Morphr to your Flutter app:

1. Update your main.dart:

  import 'package:morphr/morphr.dart';
  import 'package:your_app/morphr_options.dart';
  
  void main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    
    // Initialize Morphr with your configuration
    await MorphrService.instance.initializeCloud(options: morphrOptions);
    
    runApp(MyApp());
  }

2. Run your app and start creating great UIs with Morphr!
```

## Command Options

You can specify the Figma file URL directly as a command option:

```bash
morphr init --figma-url="https://www.figma.com/design/abcdefghijklm"
```

Or using the short form:

```bash
morphr init -f "https://www.figma.com/design/abcdefghijklm"
```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The CLI extracts the Figma file ID from the URL
2. It verifies that you have access to the file
3. It retrieves the file details to suggest a project name
4. It creates a new project on Morphr Cloud
5. It syncs the Figma file with your project (equivalent to running `morphr sync`)
6. It generates a `morphr_options.dart` file in your project's `lib` directory

## Next Steps

After initializing your project, you need to:

1. Update your `main.dart` file to initialize Morphr with your configuration
2. Start using Morphr components in your Flutter app

Now you're ready to start building your UI with Morphr components that perfectly match your Figma designs!
