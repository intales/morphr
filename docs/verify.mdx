# The `morphr verify` Command

After registering your account, you need to verify it using the verification code sent to your email address. The `verify` command handles this process.

## Basic Usage

```bash
morphr verify
```

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Use the User ID stored during registration
2. Prompt you for the verification code from your email
3. Verify your account with Morphr Cloud

## Example

```
$ morphr verify
ðŸ”‘ Enter the verification code that you have received by email: 123456
ðŸ”„ Verifying your account...
âœ… Your account is now active!
ðŸ”— To connect Figma to your account use "morphr figma-connect."
```

## Notes

- The verification code is a 6-character code sent to your email
- Your User ID is automatically retrieved from the local configuration
- Upon successful verification, your access and refresh tokens are saved locally
- If you don't receive the verification email, check your spam folder

## Command Options

You can provide the verification code directly as a command option:

```bash
morphr verify --code=123456
```

Or using the short form:

```bash
morphr verify -c 123456
```

After verifying your account, you're ready to connect your Figma account and start using Morphr's features.
