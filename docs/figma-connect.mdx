# The `morphr figma-connect` Command

To synchronize Figma designs with your app, you need to connect your Morphr account with Figma. The `figma-connect` command initiates this authorization process.

## Basic Usage

```bash
morphr figma-connect
```

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Check if you're logged in to your Morphr account
2. Initiate the Figma OAuth authorization flow
3. Provide a URL that you need to open in your browser
4. Guide you through authorizing Morphr to access your Figma files

## Example

```
$ morphr figma-connect
ðŸ”„ Initiating Figma authorization flow...
âœ… Authorization initiated successfully!
ðŸ“‹ Please open the following URL in your browser:
https://www.figma.com/oauth?client_id=xxxxx&redirect_uri=xxxxx&scope=files:read&state=xxxxx&response_type=code

ðŸ’¡ You can CMD+click (Mac) or CTRL+click (Windows/Linux) to open the URL
```

## Authorization Process

1. The CLI generates a URL for Figma's OAuth authorization
2. You open this URL in your browser
3. Figma will ask you to log in (if you're not already logged in)
4. Figma will request your permission to allow Morphr to access your files
5. After approving, you'll be redirected to a confirmation page
6. Your Morphr and Figma accounts are now connected

## Notes

- You must be logged in to Morphr before connecting with Figma
- The CLI doesn't automatically open your browser; you need to click the URL or copy and paste it
- The authorization grants Morphr read-only access to your Figma files
- This connection is necessary for syncing your Figma designs to your Flutter app

After connecting your Figma account, you're ready to create a project and start syncing your designs.
